Hi, today I will want to have a meeting about. To, umm, do the. Sales Report So my name is Xenia. So today I want to discuss about the sales in the August. I felt that the sales for the August for the milk tea of the matcha flavored is high and then I found for the chocolate flavour is low. It is the lowest flavored milk tea in our. Department. Then I want to assign some tasks to John. So John need to find the strategy, the marketing strategy to increase the sales of the chocolate flavored milk tea. Then also the Jackson can find the reason why the matcha milk tea is the high sales product in our department and then umm, is it have any? Next steps and any risk.
