Good day everyone. Today since Newtown sales have dropped, so I want to have a meeting to research the reason for the sales drop and find more marketing strategies. Yeah, the sales job is starting from June this year, so we want to find a reason from this period for marketing strategy. We will discuss more focus on social media advertising for John. You can find a way to advertise New Town on the YouTube and Facebook then even me will find. Way of inviting KOL to help us do the advertising. The task deadline for all tasks is September 10th and the urgent network is high.
